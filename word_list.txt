Create a Python-script or IPython-notebook which lists all words occuring in a text.
The script should read a sentence.
It should create a list with all the occuring words in alphabetical order and print the content of this list in oneline. The words in the output should be separated by semi-colon.
Every word should be printed only once, even if it occurs multiple times in the input.
The words in the input should be converted to lower case before being processed, so that differences in upperand lower case are ignored
